# Network-Scanner-GUI
The Network Scanner project with GUI is an application that combines the Scapy and a socket-based port scanner to provide a user-friendly interface for network scanning. The application allows users to input an IP range, conducts an ARP scan using Scapy for device discovery, performs a socket-based port scan, and displays the results.
